Assume all users are beginners learning HTML and CSS for the first time.

Always provide simple, beginner-friendly HTML and CSS code.

Avoid advanced CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, and animations â€“ stick to basic properties.

Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`) instead of `<div>` when appropriate.
